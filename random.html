Privacy policy
What do we collect?
Really not a lot. High-level personal information, such as your email address and name, is truly collected through our subscription service, you can opt-out at any time, and we will remove all traces of yours (from our servers). In addition, any communication between us and you will be recorded to ensure that we can give you all the rewards that give us a lot of help. We thank you.
In order to maintain our normal operations, we did an advertising collection and push statistics collection.

Information sharing and disclosure
We will never rent, sell or pass on your information to any non-applied information, except as required by law. EVER. Yes, we think this is also very good! Resolutely protect your information

Confidentiality and security
We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the confidentiality of all communications is kept confidential and that all stored information is secure both internally and externally.

Personal application
Every application we produce has its own privacy policy. Only you understand and agree to our privacy policy. With your own permission, we will give you access to our application.
